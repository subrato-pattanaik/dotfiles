# Configured dotfiles

This repo contains all of my dot files which I can use in different system so that I don't have to reconfigure it again and instead copy the configuration files from here and paste it in the home directory.

The inclusion of dotfiles are following,

- bash_profile
- bashrc
- gitconfig
- gitignore_global
